# Compilers Principle Project 2 Report

### Basic Design

Basic part is straightforward, I followed the visitor pattern mentioned in our lab section. By design a name space called `visitor`, and design the individual visit function for each semantic block.

```C++
struct visitor {
	static void program(Node* self) {...}
	static void ext_def_list(Node* self) {...}
	static void ext_def(Node* self) {...}
    ...
}
```

Hence it can recursively search the entire semantic tree and find its error.

As for symbol table design, I uses a symbol table stack to distinguish each scope. The bottom is the global scope, the top is the current scope.

> Scope Stack:
> 	Current Scope    - Top
> 	...
> 	...
> 	...
> 	Global Scope     - Bottom

### Bonus Design

#### Removal of assumptions

For the assumptions listed in the document, my implementation can remove all but 4th one.

The removal of **Assumption 1, 2, 3** is straightforward, just check for operand's type when perform certain operation.

Here I will focus on the last three assumptions.

##### Assumption 5

This assumption means there is no overlapping in structure definitions. It is removed by not storing member info of a structure inside symbol table instead, member info can be stored inside structure definition and not pushed into symbol table.

```C++
struct Struct {
    std::string name;
    std::vector<Field*> fields;
};
```

If member are stored inside a structure, they will not occupy the places in the symbol table.

This leads to another problem, what if there is one structure that contains two member with the **same** name. I do a check for this situation and set it as the 16th error.

```c++
if (self->rule == 1) {
   structure->fields = def_list(self->children[3]);
   for (auto repeat_f : _repeat_struct_field(structure->fields)) {
        add_err(ErrorType::MEM_REDEF, repeat_f->lineno, "Repeated field name inside structure",
                        repeat_f->name.c_str());
       }
}
```

As for the overlapping of **structure name** and **variable name**, this is taken care of by the design of symbol table entry. Each symbol table entry is actually a three length tuple for storing **function name**, **structure name** and **variable name** separately. Hence they will not interference each other.

```C++
if (iter == scope->end()) {
    array<Entry*, 3> entry_arr{0, 0, 0}; // Multiple item in the same entry, distinguished by 											 //	their type
    entry_arr[(int)entry->entry_type] = entry;
    scope->insert({entry->name(), entry_arr});
}
```

##### Assumption 6

This is removed by the **scope stack** mentioned in basic design.

##### Assumption 7

This is removed by the **recursive type checking**.

```C++
    static bool _is_equivalent(Type* s1, Type* s2) {
        if (s1->category == Category::PRIMITIVE &&
            s2->category == Category::PRIMITIVE) {
            return s1->primitive == s2->primitive;
        } else if (s1->category == Category::STRUCT &&
                   s2->category == Category::STRUCT) {
            auto fields_1 = s1->structure->fields;
            auto fields_2 = s2->structure->fields;
            if (fields_1.size() == fields_2.size()) {
                int s = fields_1.size();
                for (int i = 0; i < s; i++) {
                    if (!_is_equivalent(fields_1[i]->type, fields_2[i]->type))
                        return false;
                }
            } else
                return false;
        } else if (s1->category == Category::ARRAY &&
                   s2->category == Category::ARRAY)
            return s1->array->size == s2->array->size &&
                   _is_equivalent(s1->array->base, s2->array->base);
        else
            return false;
        return true;
    }
```

**THIS MAY CAUSE CONFLICTS WITH THE NAME EQUIVALENCE TEST CASES**

##### Detection of undefined structure

As my implementation will push structure definitions into stack too, hence my semantic analyzer is capable of detect whether a structure is defined or not. I've given it a error label 17th

```c++
    static Type* _type_exist(Type* type, int lineno) {
        if (type->category == Category::STRUCT) {
            Type* t = lookup(type->structure->name, EntryType::TYPE)->type;
            if (t == NULL)
                add_err(ErrorType::STRUCT_NO_DEF, lineno, "Type not exist",
                        type->structure->name.c_str());
            return t;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
```
